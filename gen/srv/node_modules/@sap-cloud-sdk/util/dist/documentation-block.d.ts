/**
 * @experimental This API is experimental and might change in newer versions. Use with caution.
 * Transform strings and arguments to a string formatted as a documentation block.
 * The formatting is block like so no leading or trailing spaces.
 * New lines in the beginning and end are also removed.
 * Use in tagged templates, e.g.:
 * ```
 * documentationBlock`Docs with ${arguments} and more content;`
 * ```
 * @param strings - Strings in the tagged template. In the example above that would be ['Docs with ', ' and more content;'].
 * @param args - Arguments in the tagged template. In the example above that would be the resolved value for `arguments`;.
 * @returns A string formatted as documentation block.
