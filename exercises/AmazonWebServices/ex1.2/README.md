## Exercise 1.2.2- Consume S4-Mock-Server API by using Remote Service functionality provided by SAP CAP

In our Business Partner Service, we need to fetch the latest Business Partner data from the S4-Mock-Server by consuming the OP_API_BUSINESS_PARTNER_SRV API exposed by S4-Mocker-Server application.

In this section, we will introduce how to consume the external APIs by using the [Remote Service](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/using-services#introduction) functionality in the SAP CAP application.

> **Good to read before start**
>
> - [Consuming Services](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/using-services)
>
> The CAP runtimes for node.js not only supports consuming the service via [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), Fetch API, but also provides you an easy functionlity, called [Remote Service](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/using-services#introduction) to consume the external CAP service or OData Service.

1. 👉 Now let's define the S4-Mock-Server service endpoint, and install the required NPM packages of CAP project, so that we could consume the S4-Mock-Server in the CAP project successfully.

Open the package.json file under the root directory of your CAP Project and append the code shown on below under the **cds.requires.s4_mock_server**. 

**Do not forgot to replace the CHANGE-TO-YOUR-S4-Mocker-Server-Application-Endpoint with your real S4-Mocker-Server service endpoint.**

```node.js
"[sandbox]": {
    "credentials": {
        "url": "https://CHANGE-TO-YOUR-S4-Mocker-Server-Application-Endpoint/op-api-business-partner-srv"
    }
},
"[production]": {
    "credentials": {
        "url": "https://CHANGE-TO-YOUR-S4-Mocker-Server-Application-Endpoint/op-api-business-partner-srv"
    }
}
```
