# Exercise 1.3 Integrate the CAP Application with Amazon SNS

This exercise is part of the openSAP course [Build Resilient Applications on SAP BTP with Amazon Web Services](https://open.sap.com/courses/aws1), Week 3 Unit 4 - Integrate the CAP Application with Amazon SNS.

In the exercie of this unit, we will intorduce how to integrate the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) with our Business Partner Validation application, By using the AWS SDK for SNS. After finish this exercise, you will achieve the following objectives
 - Understand how to conifugre the Amazon Simple Notification Service Topic on the AWS Management Console.
 - Understand how to protect your Amazon SNS Topic with Amazon IAM Access Policy.
 - Understands how to consuming the Amazon SNS Topic programmatically within the SAP CAP project by using the AWS SDK for SNS.

**You could find the complete sample code of this exercise [here](../sample-code)**.

## Exercise 1.3.1 Setup Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

> - Please not down below values after you finish this section
>   - Amazon SNS Topic ARN
>   - Amazon SNS Topic Reigon
>   - Amazon IAM User Access Key
>   - Amazon IAM User Secret Access Key

Amazon Simple Notification Service is a regional service, please create the Amazon SNS Topic in the AWS region which is equals to the region of your BTP subaccount, so that we could minimize the lattency.

### Step 1. Create Amazon SNS Topic

**1.1** Open **Amazon Simple Notification Service Management Console**, click **Topics** on the left panel, then click the **Create Topic** button.

**1.3** Once the topic creation complete successfully, **note down** the **Topic ARN** (Amazon Resource Name) and **Topic Region** value. We will use it later in the exercise.

> - You could find the Topic Region value inside of the Topic ARN.

## Exercise 1.3.2 Consuming the Amazon Simple Notification Service Topic in SAP CAP Project.

### Prerequisites
You have completed the [Section 1. Setup Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://github.com/anbazhagan-uma/opensap-btp-aws/blob/main/Week%203/Unit%203.4/README.md#section-1-setup-amazon-simple-notification-service-sns) and have the below values handy.
- **Amazon SNS Topic ARN**
- **Amazon SNS Topic Reigon**
- **Amazon IAM User Access Key**
- **Amazon IAM User Secret Access Key**
- **Frontend Fiori application's URL** 


### Step 1. Install AWS SDK for Node.js in the SAP CAP Project

**1.1** Open the Business Partner Validation project in the SAP Business Application Studio. Open a new ternimal and then issue the command **npm install @aws-sdk/client-sns --save**.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-1.png)

**1.2** After the installation completed, open the **package.json** file under your project root directory. You will see that the AWS SDK - SNS Client has been addedd under the **dependencies** section.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-2.png)

### Step 2. Modify the SAP CAP Project Code

**2.1** Let's **modify the package.json file** under the **project's root directory**, so that we could add the AWS SNS credentials, and also the frontend Fiori application's endpint as the environment variables. Add te code shown on below into your package.json file under the **cds.requires** section.

```node.js
"cds":{
  ...
  "requires":{
    ...
    "aws": {
      "sns": {
        "topicArn": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-SNS-TOPIC-ARN",
        "region": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-SNS-TOPIC-REGION"
      },
      "iam": {
        "accessKey": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-IAM-USER-ACCESS-KEY",
        "secretAccessKey": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-IAM-USER-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY"
      }
    },
    "launchpad": {
      "url": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-FRONTEND-FIORI-APPLICATION-URL"
    },
  }
}
```

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-3.png)


**2.2** Open the **srv/businesspartner-service.js** file. Let's first import the AWS SNS Client, and CAP CDS environment variables we just defined into this file. 

```node.js
const { SNSClient, PublishCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-sns');
const { aws, launchpad } = cds.env.requires;
```

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-4.png)

**2.3** Let's creates an new async function, which will be responsible for sending out the email notification programmatically to the Amazon SNS Topic.

```node.js
async function sendEmailNotification(bpID){

    const REGION = aws.sns.region;
    const SNS_TOPIC_ARN = aws.sns.topicArn;
    const AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = aws.iam.accessKey;
    const AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = aws.iam.secretAccessKey;
    const businessPartnerID = bpID;

    const snsClient = new SNSClient({
        region: REGION,
        credentials:{
            accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
            secretAccessKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
        },
    });

    let message = `Business Partner ${businessPartnerID} Records Has Been Changed, Please Review and Perform the Validation ASAP. \n`;
    message += `Please use below link to go the site.\n`;
    message += launchpad.url;
    
    let params = {

        Message: message,
        TopicArn: SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
    };

    try{
        const data = await snsClient.send(new PublishCommand(params));
        console.log("Success.",  data);
    }catch(error){
        console.log(error.message);
    }
};
```

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-5.png)

**2.4** Finally, let's **enhance** the **syncData function** to **leavage the sendEmailNotification function** we just created. Add the code shown on below at the **very end** of the syncData function.

```node.js

async function syncData(req){

  ....,

  // Send out SNS Notification while Business Partner's Verfication Status = P
  if(verificationStatus_code === 'P'){

    await sendEmailNotification(bpID);
  }
}
```

### Step 3. Deploy the Code Changes to the SAP BTP Trial Subaccount

> - Make sure your SAP HANA DB is in the running status. The SAP HANA DB in the SAP BTP trial account will stop every single night automatically.

**3.1** **Right click** on the **mat.yaml** file under your project root directory, and then choose **Build MTA Project** from the menu. 

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-8.png)

**3.2** Once the MTA Build process is complete, expand the **mta_archives** folder, **right click** on the **business-partner-validation_1.0.0.mtar** file. Choose **Deploy MTA Archive** from the menu to trigger the SAP BTP trial deployment process.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-7.png)

**3.3** Wait until the deployment process to be completed. Grab a cup of coffee and take a rest as the deployment process will take some times.

## Exercise 1.3.3 Testing the Business Partner Validation Application from End-to-End

**3.1** Go back to your SAP BTP Trial subaccount. Go to **Instance and Subscriptions**. Click **Go to application** button of the **SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition** service subscription.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-9.png)

**3.2** Click **Go to site** button to navigate to the OpenSAP-AWS-Course-Week3 site.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-10.png)

**3.3** Click Manage Business Partner App.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-11.png)

**3.4** Now click **Go** to browse all unblocked Business Partner Data fetching from S4-Mock-Server. Now you will see all the Business Partners are in the VERIFIED status.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-12.png)

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-13.png)

**3.5** Click on the first Business Partner 1004155 record in the table, this will navigate you to the details page. Let's now try to update the address data of this business partner by clicking the edit button.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-14.png)

**3.6** **Update the business partner data as shown on the image below**. Then click **Save** to persist the updated data to the SAP HANA DB. **Make sure to update the Verification Status value from V to P by selecting from the dropdown**. Now we should expected to receive an email notification sent from the Amazon SNS topic we created previsouly.

![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-15.png)

**3.7** Open your email box, then you should see an email with the tilte **AWS Notifications**. Open this email and you should see the message to indicate us the Business Partner 1004155 record has been changed. The Fiori application of the Business Partner Validation app is also includes in the emial. We could click on this URL and it will redirect us back to the Fiori application.

## Congratulation!
 
Conratulations, you have successfully integrated the Amazon Simple Notification service with SAP CAP project and deployed the entire project to the SAP BTP Trial subaccount successfully. Well done !!
