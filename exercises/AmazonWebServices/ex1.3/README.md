## Step 5 - Consuming the Amazon Simple Notification Service Topic in the SAP CAP Project.


  You have completed Step 1 - Setup Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and have the below values handy.
- **Amazon SNS Topic ARN**
- **Amazon SNS Topic Region**
- **Amazon IAM User Access Key**
- **Amazon IAM User Secret Access Key**
- **Frontend Fiori application's URL** 

1. ðŸ‘‰ Let's Install AWS SDK for Node.js in the SAP CAP Project. Open the Business Partner Validation project in the SAP Business Application Studio. Open a new terminal and then issue the command **npm install @aws-sdk/client-sns --save**.

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-1.png)

2. ðŸ‘‰ After the installation is completed, open the **package.json** file under your project root directory. You will see that the AWS SDK - SNS Client has been added under the **dependencies** section.

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-2.png)

## Step 6 - Modify the SAP CAP Project Code

1. ðŸ‘‰ Let's **modify the package.json file** under the **project's root directory**, so that we can add the AWS SNS credentials, and also the frontend Fiori application's endpoint as the environment variables. Ensure you have the below details in package.json under the **cds.requires** section.

    ```node.js
    "cds":{
      ...
      "requires":{
        ...
        "aws": {
          "sns": {
            "topicArn": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-SNS-TOPIC-ARN",
            "region": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-SNS-TOPIC-REGION"
          },
          "iam": {
            "accessKey": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-IAM-USER-ACCESS-KEY",
            "secretAccessKey": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-IAM-USER-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY"
          }
        },
        "launchpad": {
          "url": "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-FRONTEND-FIORI-APPLICATION-URL"
        },
      }
    }
    ```

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-3.png)


2. ðŸ‘‰ Open the **srv/businesspartner-service.js** file. Let's first import the AWS SNS Client, and CAP CDS environment variables we just defined into this file. 

    ```node.js
    const { SNSClient, PublishCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-sns');
    const { aws, launchpad } = cds.env.requires;
    ```

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-4.png)

3. ðŸ‘‰ Let's create a new async function, which will be responsible for sending out the email notification programmatically to the Amazon SNS Topic.

    ```node.js
    async function sendEmailNotification(bpID){

        const REGION = aws.sns.region;
        const SNS_TOPIC_ARN = aws.sns.topicArn;
        const AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = aws.iam.accessKey;
        const AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = aws.iam.secretAccessKey;
        const businessPartnerID = bpID;

        const snsClient = new SNSClient({
            region: REGION,
            credentials:{
                accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                secretAccessKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
            },
        });

        let message = `Business Partner ${businessPartnerID} Records Has Been Changed, Please Review and Perform the Validation ASAP. \n`;
        message += `Please use below link to go the site.\n`;
        message += launchpad.url;
        
        let params = {

            Message: message,
            TopicArn: SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
        };

        try{
            const data = await snsClient.send(new PublishCommand(params));
            console.log("Success.",  data);
        }catch(error){
            console.log(error.message);
        }
    };
    ```

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-5.png)

4. ðŸ‘‰ Finally, let's **enhance** the **syncData function** to **leverage the sendEmailNotification function** we just created. Add the code shown below at the **very end** of the syncData function.

    ```node.js

    async function syncData(req){

      ....,

      // Send out SNS Notification while Business Partner's Verfication Status = P
      if(verificationStatus_code === 'P'){

        await sendEmailNotification(bpID);
      }
    }
    ```

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-6.png)

## Step 7 -  Deploy the Code Changes to the SAP BTP Trial Subaccount

> - Make sure your SAP HANA DB is in the running status. The SAP HANA DB in the SAP BTP trial account will stop every single night automatically.

1. ðŸ‘‰ **Right-click** on the **mat.yaml** file under your project root directory, and then choose **Build MTA Project** from the menu. 

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-8.png)

2. ðŸ‘‰ Once the MTA Build process is complete, expand the **mta_archives** folder, **right click** on the **business-partner-validation_1.0.0.mtar** file. Choose **Deploy MTA Archive** from the menu to trigger the SAP BTP trial deployment process.

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-7.png)

3. ðŸ‘‰ Wait until the deployment process is completed. Grab a cup of coffee and take a rest as the deployment process will take some time.

## Step 8 -  Testing the Business Partner Validation Application from End-to-End

1.

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-13.png)

5. ðŸ‘‰ Click on the first Business Partner 1004155 record in the table, this will navigate you to the details page. Let's now try to update the address data of this business partner by clicking the edit button.

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-14.png)

6. ðŸ‘‰ **Update the business partner data as shown in the image below**. Then click **Save** to persist the updated data to the SAP HANA DB. **Make sure to update the Verification Status value from V to P by selecting from the dropdown**. Now we should expect to receive an email notification sent from the Amazon SNS topic we created previously.

    ![Alt text](./images/aws-cap-dev-15.png)

7. ðŸ‘‰ Open your email box, then you should see an email with the title **AWS Notifications******. Open this email and you should see the message to indicate us the Business Partner 1004155 record has been changed. The Fiori application of the Business Partner Validation app is also included in the email. We could click on this URL and it will redirect us back to the Fiori application.
