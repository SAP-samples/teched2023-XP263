# Exercise 2- Creating a new view of "Product Sales Country Discount"
This exercise focuses on creating a new data view called **"Product Sales Country Discount"**. This view will be created by joining **"Product Sales Country"** with the **"Discount by Category Date"** view, which is federated from the SAP S/4HANA system. The purpose of this process is to combine the data from the two views to create a comprehensive view of product sales and discounts by country and date. The resulting **"Product Sales Country Discount"** view will provide valuable insights into sales trends, allowing you to make informed decisions about promotions and discounts.

To complete this exercise, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Join the "Product Sales Country" view with the "Discount by Category Date" view, using a common field such as "Date" and "category"
   >HINT: you need to create a LEFT Join
2. Identify the missing measures from the attributes and move them to measures
   >HINT: attributes: Sessions, Hits
3. Create an **Association** of the final view to **Time Dimension - Day**
   >HINT: you need to map following attribute: DATE

Your goal is to navigate through these steps and create a comprehensive data view that accurately reflects product sales and discounts by country and date. Best of luck!
